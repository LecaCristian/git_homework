# What is GIT
Git is a distributed version control system that is commonly used for tracking changes in source code during software development.


# Understanding the GIT 
Think of Git as a time machine for your work. It saves snapshots of your project's progress, so you can go back to any point in time.
This is super helpful if something goes wrongâ€”you can always go back to the last working version.
